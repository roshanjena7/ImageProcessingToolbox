MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox

🚀 A simple and modular MATLAB GUI to explore basic image processing techniques.

📖 Description

The MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox is a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates core image processing methods using a clean GUI. Users can load an image, apply filters, and instantly visualize results. Features include:

✅ Grayscale conversion

✅ Edge detection (Canny)

✅ Histogram equalization

✅ Smoothing filter (average)

✅ Sharpening filter

This project is modular, with each function stored separately, making it easy to extend with new filters. Ideal for students, hobbyists, and researchers learning MATLAB GUI and image processing basics.
